            <h1 style="height: auto;padding: 6px;font-family: 'Fira Sans', sans-serif;margin-bottom: 7px;margin-top: 5px;">What is skill exchange?</h1>
            <p style="font-family: 'Hind Vadodara', sans-serif;">Many people attach different values to different skills, and have less of a desire to do some skills and more of a desire to do others. For example, some people might not like cooking, but might love designing architecture. Oftentimes, those people are quite good at doing what they love.</p>
            <p>However, at many points in their life, people have to do things they don't like or don't know how to do. Whether it be manual labor, web development, or negotiation, there will always be something that is distasteful or unknown to a person. If they have the means, these types of situations are usually handled through the exchange of money. A person pays another to do the work that they won't, or cannot, do. That is, in fact, the basis of society.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Running deeper than money in each of us is the "gratitude-compensation" mentality. If someone gives us something or does something to us, we feel inclined to give them something back or do something to them. In modern times, this "compensation" takes the form of money.</p>
            <p>Skill Exchange bypasses money transactions entirely.*&nbsp; It goes straight to the "gratitude-compensation" mentality by giving people the chance to do something they love to do instead of paying money. All they are really "paying" is time.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: -13px;">Jumping over the hurdle of money is actually jumping over many hurdles, both for the customers and for us, the company. Problems such as conversion fees, transaction fees, and unequal inflation rates don't have to be worried about. This allows us to give you lower prices and a better user experience.</p>

                            <p>With Skill Exchange, however, Aiden and Sebastian will meet each other, and they will be able to arrange a deal. Sebastian will bake food for Aiden if Aiden fixes Sebastian's pipes. The future doesn't seem so bad after all!</p>

                            <p>Normally, John would have to hire a management team to help start a company. This would cost him money and time, or his business if he can't provide both.<br>Sue would have to search around until she finds a good (meaning Michelin-star worthy) German restaurant, which she will also have to pay for every time she eats. She will lose money and time or her taste of German cuisine if she can't provide both.</p>
                            <p>With Skill Exchange, however, John and Sue would be brought together. After both of them agree, John will be able to start his restaurant business, and Sue can get her German cuisine. Moreover, it won't cost them!</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Vadodara', sans-serif;">The concept is pretty simple: you simply pull up the app or website, find what you need, and offer what you can give. It's as simple as that.</p>
        <p>In a deeper sense, our app allows for a new way of economics. Of course, there is no steady way to live solely through Skill Exchange. But we put our values on a 50/50 belief system where you get what you can give. With that being said, our service allows you to put out your special set of skills in your own profile. If you need anything done you can call upon another person and offer to trade your skills for theirs. Likewise, if someone ask for your help they will offer you something in return. If one of you don't agree with the others offer you could always politely decline.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Hind Vadodara', sans-serif;">Moreover, we understand that there might be problems. Due to that, we have&nbsp; strict security and privacy protection policies. Your address is only shared to those people who you request. They are notified of a "fake" address you have the ability to choose, and you have the option to tell the address to them over our service or by going and bringing them to your location. You also get the option to hide your legal name and go by a generated nickname. We also have a strict no-crime policy. If any crimes are committed, the people can report them and we can ban them. We have a strong legal team that can back you in legal matters.** As always, our goal is to make sure users have the best and safest experience on our service as much as possible.</p>
